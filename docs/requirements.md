### Model a factory producing hardware devices.

Each device consists of parts.
Each part must have a SKU to be able to be distinguished from other Parts

SKU for the same item may vary per company

We keep record of the vendors SKU so when can better confront the vendor on problems.

In our system we are associating vendors with guids to identity them and a name.

We need to track reception of parts from vendors.

The external SKU must never be printed as Barcode.

Store a photo scan of the external barcode/QR code.
